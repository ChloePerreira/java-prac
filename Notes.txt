Given a matrix of nodes, some of which are connected and some of which are not
Nodes represented by index array where number of node is index
Objects filling in array are the connections (index of the node)
Objects only connected to ones with higher indices
But only connectd to something lower? 
Wtf?!
Go from high to low
Clusters are called connected components

Connected takes in node a and b (both indices of the array) and has access to the 
connections array

Union -- checks if connected and if not connected, then makes the connection 
Returns new array with new values and indices
